# Movie App

This is something I created to improve myself as a react developer. Those who inspect the code may find out that all implementations are not optimal. That is because this project is meant to serve as a playground for me to train new aspects of react development.

Important technical implementations:

    React hooks
    Context api
    SmoothScroll
    Styled components
    Api Calls
    CSS 3d animations
