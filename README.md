# Movie App

![preview](https://github.com/psaarine/movieapp/blob/main/preview_image/movieapp_preview.png)

This is something I created to improve myself as a react developer. It can be inspected closer [here](https://psaarine.github.io/movieapp/).Those who inspect the code may find out that all implementations are not optimal. That is because this project is meant to serve as a playground for me to train new aspects of react development.

Important technical implementations:

    React hooks
    Context api
    SmoothScroll
    Styled components
    Api Calls
    CSS 3d animations

Some of the elemental concepts of react, such as router, have not been touched here. Thats why I have another react project that includes them. This project can be seen [here](https://github.com/psaarine/spotifyshop).
